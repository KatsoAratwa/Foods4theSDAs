    <b>A LITTLE GET TO KNOW ME...</b>
    <br>
    My love for cooking started in the kitchen with my mother, where I learned an important lesson that I still cherish today — always serve a balanced meal.
    Growing up, food was not just something we ate; it was a way of bringing our family together with care and love.
    
    Originally, I was a member of the Jehovah’s Witnesses. However, everything changed when I visited a Seventh-day Adventist Church in Lobatse Central with a close friend.
    From the moment I entered, I felt a sense of belonging, like I am in my father's house indeed and purpose that I had never experienced before.
    I knew in my heart that this was the right spiritual home for me.
    
    I began dedicating my time and soul to learning more about the Seventh-day Adventist faith — studying their customs, standards of dress, and especially their teachings about health and food.
    It was a journey of change: I adapted my diet to align with the Adventist principles of healthy, plant-based eating.
    Even though I was the only Adventist in my family, I slowly introduced these beautiful principles into our family meals, blending tradition with a new way of life focused on health, balance, and faith. As it
    says in 1 Corinthians 10:31  "So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God." This verse always reminds me that our bodies are the temple of the Lord and we have to cherish them.
    
    Through this website, I want to share with current Adventists so that they can get new meal ideas and more importantly New Adventists so that can know what to eat and what not to eat. I hope to share the joy of healthy
    4 living with the rest of the world. Amen.
    <br>
